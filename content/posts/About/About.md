#### What is this site and who am I ?


My Name is K.C , Cyber Security is key to the world more than most know.

The Aim try educate and help others get into the cyber security world for the right reasons.
With the growing threat for both consumers and businsses more people need to be aware of the threats surrounding them in their day to day life.

This site is a collection of my findings, guides or just general info for people to read, learn and hopefully take inspiration. 


#### Why this site ?


Unfortunately at the moment many SMBs only invest in security after its too late. 
By changing the mindset of their employees and people with the view of security, it's one step in the right direction.

I've learnt a lot from what I've found online so thought I'd Give something back for others to learn from.



#### Site notes

This site is still in beta and will be constantly changing.
I will be adding content reguallry and once theres a reasonable amount up there I will focus on standardising formatting.

Once Things have progressed I will put up a contact email for you to ask for suggestion Posts and improvements.
