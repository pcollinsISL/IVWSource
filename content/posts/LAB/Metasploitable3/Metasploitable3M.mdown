These are my ongoing findings of metasploitable3.

A Video/Tutorial of a setup guide will be posted later on.




### Nmap Scan

Here are the list of open ports on the Vuln Server.

### Vuln scans 

I would recommend putting off vuln scans to make you learn the process of finding vulns yourself rather than automated.

####  Nessus

Nessus is a free vulnerability scanner (can be pro) similar to Open-vas.
I've run a scan in nessus which then has been imported into the MSF Database.
Scans can be run in the metasploit command line or via the applications GUI.

####   Nmap NSE

Nmap NSE SMB script scan shows that it is vulnerable to MS17-010.

### 21 - FTP - Microsoft FTPD

#### Bruteforce

Using hydra  I've tested the following  username/passwords.
Only the vagrant one so far but still gives you access.

```
FAILED
Hydra -l root -P metasploit/common_roots.txt  -f 192.168.226.20 ftp -v    ÃŸ
Hydra -l root -P metasploit/mirai_pass.txt  -f 192.168.226.20 ftp -v
Hydra -l root -P metasploit/passwords.lst  -f 192.168.226.20 ftp -v

SUCCESS 
Hydra -L ftpusername.txt -P metasploit/common_roots.txt ftp -v   (administrator:vagrant)
```

The FTP is the site files of the port 80 IIS website. This can then be used to upload a reverse shell, run local root exploits etc.

I've also tried to use a traversal attack to escape the dir location but this was unsuccessful.
This can be done manually or via a tool such as dotdotpwn as shown bellow.

There are however flags which can be downloaded for later inspection.
```
- six_of_diamonds.zip
- seven_of_hearts.html
```
FTP sites can also be viewed in a web browser.

### 445 - SMB 

#### Eternal Blue (ms17-010)  NSA exploit with Metasploit

I'm sure you've heard about the shadowbrokers NSA exploit dump over the last year.
Metasploit has a module for the nicknamed "Eternal Blue" Exploit.

Gives you a system shell,  this can be done manually as well.

### 3306 - mysql 5.5.20

#### Nmap port/service info 

![MS3N](/img/LAB/M3/3306N.png)

#### Nmap NSE scripts

![MS3N](/img/LAB/M3/3306NSE.png)

#### Bruteforce
![MS3N](/img/LAB/M3/3306NSEB.png)

#### Database Enumeration

![MS3N](/img/LAB/M3/3306SQLDBWPUP.png)

In the "cards" Database there was a queen of cards flag encoded.
Can extract the table with the code bellow

![MS3N](/img/LAB/M3/3306SQLDBCQE.png)

```
mysql -u root -h <Target> cards -e 'select card from queen_of_hearts;' > queen_of_hearts.txt'
```

###  8022 - ManageEnginee - Desktop Central

#### Brute force

![MS3N](/img/LAB/M3/8022MSFB.png)

#### Metasploit Exploit
![MS3N](/img/LAB/M3/8022MSFMCWE.png)


### 8585 - Apache 2.2.21 ((Win64)PHP /5.3.10 DAV/2)

#### - WebDAV

Using metasploit you can do WebDav Enumeration.

![MS3N](/img/LAB/M3/8585MSFWDT.png)

This shows us we can upload a  PHP shell. Creating a meterpreter shell in msfvenom, this can then be uploaded via cadaver.
The PHP shell needs editing to add <? ?> at the start and end of the script.

![MS3N](/img/LAB/M3/8585MSFSHELL.png)

#### 8595 - Wordpress 

By using WPScan it reveals the location of upload location, This then has some more flags in.
There are a fair amount of WP exploits than can be run here as well due to outdated plugins.

### 9200 / 9300 - ElasticSearch REST API 1.1.1 (name: Nico Minoru; Lucene 4.7)

Metasploit has some modules for enumerating the serve and even a directory traversal exploit which it is vulnerable too.

#### Indices_enum
![MS3N](/img/LAB/M3/9300MSFE.png)
#### Elastic_traversal

![MS3N](/img/LAB/M3/9300MSFET.png)

#### Metasploit Exploit

Elasticsearch 1.1.1 is vulnerable to a Script_mvel_RCE exploit. This can be used to gain a java meterpreter shell on the server.
By using meterpreter I've done a big of recon for the the flags as well as a local shell "Net User" to find the local accounts.
This can then be used for hash cracking but also bruteforcing of accounts.
Creating a local user account that you can use later for persistence is always a good option.

#### From Java Meterpreter to Binary Meterpreter shell


The Java meterpreter has issues running some of the metasploit modules.
But you can upload a binary (exe) payload and then run this to get yourself a meterpreter shell.

Once a system shell was gained I could then dump the hashes of the server as well as check for local exploits.
