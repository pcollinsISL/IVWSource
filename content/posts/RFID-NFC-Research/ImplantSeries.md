### Flex ###
The Flex Series however require a more surgical approach. By slicing and creating a pocket under the skin for the implant to go.
More information can be found here about these implants and they're not for the faint of hearted. 
There is a big performance increase with the Flex Series which is why they're more favourable as long as you're able to have the procedure done.
