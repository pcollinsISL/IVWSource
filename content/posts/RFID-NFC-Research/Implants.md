The flexNT is a flexible biopolymer treated inlay carrying the NTAG216 chip (the same chip as the xNT), which is approximately 8mm wide by 22mm long. These devices are small-batch manufactured by hand in our lab, so not every flexNT will be uniform size. They are shipped in small sealed plastic tubes with chlorhexidine solution.

### VivoKey 
http://vivokey.com/

Amal Graafstra, founder of biohacking company Dangerous Things, recognized that identity and the issues surrounding establishing, managing, validating, and protecting identity are currently a huge mess. Your biological self and the collection of accounts, services, messages, transactions, and records which make up your digital identity exist as two identities, which are only loosely coupled by vulnerable account passwords and impractical or interceptable technologies. So, he launched Project UKI (/yoo key/) to change that, which eventually became VivoKey. You can be you (and nobody else can), anywhere, all the time. You + VivoKey means your biological and digital identities can be cryptographically merged, ensuring the one true you is the only you using your devices, sending your messages, reading your email, accessing your accounts, opening your doors, driving your vehicles, and spending your money.

Fidesmo is a multi-application platform with the goal of replacing every card in your wallet and key in your pocket with a single device. By partnering with Fidesmo, VivoKey is empowered by an ever growing ecosystem of powerful applications and partnerships. As more partners begin to publish their applications through Fidesmo, the power of VivoKey will grow right along with Fidesmo. What's more, developers are welcome to create and deploy their own applications through an easy to use API.
