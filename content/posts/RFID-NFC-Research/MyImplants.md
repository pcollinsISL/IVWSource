I've decided to order the following from Dangerious things to have implanted.

* xEM
* FlexNT
* VivoKey (When Released)

Once the DesFire is out I will take a look at the potential applications for it that I could use.

I'm waiting on parts and the implants which should take 1-2 months. Once arrived I will upload the implanting and healing procceses etc.

Will then also fill out the Project posts as well.
