So Here is a tool called TheFatRat, can check out [HERE](https://github.com/Screetsec/TheFatRat "TheFatRat GitHub Link"). 
It's still in development but it's easy to follow and has some easy to use features.


#### MSFVenon wndows EXE Payload and Encoding ####


You can check how to create a metaploit reverse shell payload  with just MsfVenom Here   - ADD LINK HERE --

The neat thing that TheFatRat Does is add a load of encoding of the payload by default which will help with avoiding AV Detection.


By Selecting option 2 you are then prompted to enter in the following,

1. Local IP < Attacker IP> 
+ LPORT <Port to connect back on>
+ File Output name <EXE Name>
