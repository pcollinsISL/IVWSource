      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to order the following from Dangerious things to have implanted.
 xEM FlexNT VivoKey (When Released)  Once the DesFire is out I will take a look at the potential applications for it that I could use.
I&amp;rsquo;m waiting on parts and the implants which should take 1-2 months. Once arrived I will upload the implanting and healing procceses etc.
Will then also fill out the Project posts as well.</description>
